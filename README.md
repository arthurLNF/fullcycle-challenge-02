# Full Cycle Challenge #02

This app lists people registered in a table stored in a mysql DB.
The app is written in node.js, with only one file, since architecture isn't the main goal of the project, but run a node.js application connected to a mysql database using nginx as reverse proxy.

Clone this repo and "run docker-compose up -d" to see the app running. It's simple, but it does it's job.
